# FFASPNetCore
This is a working sample for creating an ASP.NET app in App Configuration using Feature Flags, dynamic refresh, and labels. 
Please note that you need to have created a configuration store and set up the correct enviornmental variables, this will not work out of the box on your machine. 
This followed the tutorials for [ASP.NET Feature Flags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-feature-flag-aspnet-core?tabs=core5x) and [ASP.NET Dynamic configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/enable-dynamic-configuration-aspnet-core?tabs=core5x).
